## Project Description:

&emsp;&emsp;This is the first checkpoint for the project which is to build a processor.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;For checkpoint 1, I need to design and simulate an Arithmetic Logical Unit(ALU) by Quartus with verilog. I need to implement an adder that supports addition and subtraction which is non-RCA adder for two 32-bits numbers.<br>
<br>

## Design Description

&emsp;&emsp;I use the verilog to design the ALU and simulate it in the Quartus. My AUL implements addition and subtraction for two 32-bits number.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;For the ALU, there are 4 inputs and 4 outputs. Two input 32-bits numbers are 'data_operandA' and  'data_operandB' <br>

&emsp;&emsp;<br>
