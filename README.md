## Project Description:

&emsp;&emsp;This is the first checkpoint for the project which is to build a processor.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;For checkpoint 1, I need to design and simulate an Arithmetic Logical Unit(ALU) by Quartus with verilog. I need to implement an adder that supports addition and subtraction which is non-RCA adder for two 32-bits numbers.<br>
