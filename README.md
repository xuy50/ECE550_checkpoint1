## Project Description:

&emsp;&emsp;This is the first checkpoint for the project which is to build a processor.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;For checkpoint 1, I need to design and simulate an Arithmetic Logical Unit(ALU) by Quartus with verilog. I need to implement an adder that supports addition and subtraction which is non-RCA adder for two 32-bits numbers.<br>
<br>

## Design Description

&emsp;&emsp;I use the verilog to design the ALU and simulate it in the Quartus. My AUL implements addition and subtraction for two 32-bits number.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;For the ALU, there are 4 inputs and 4 outputs:<br>

&emsp;&emsp;Two input 32-bits numbers are `data_operandA` and  `data_operandB`, the ALU operation control code is `ctrl_ALUopcode`, which is used to identify and control operations. The input `ctrl_shiftamt` is used to get shift amount for SLL and SRA operations, which only needs to be used in SLL and SRA operations.<br>
